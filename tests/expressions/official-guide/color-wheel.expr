#atan2 returns the angle between 0,0 and y,x
#atan2's range is (-pi,pi], here we convert to (0, 1]
#we first divide by 'pi' to give us the range (-1, 1]
#then we add 1 to get (0, 2]
#finally, we divide by 2 to get (0, 1]
 diskposition = ( 1+atan2(y,x)/pi ) / 2;

#scale diskposition by 360 for hue output:
 colordisk = diskposition * 360;

#add time to get the disk rotating
#200time is a shortcut for 200 * time:
 huerot = colordisk + 200time;

#output:
 x' = x;
 y' = y;
 
 h = huerot;
 s = 1;
